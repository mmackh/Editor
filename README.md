## Editor

Attempt at writing a code editor in UIKit for the Mac from scratch. There are many missing core features and there are occasional crashes. Writing a text editor is a humbling experience that I've spent many months on. No external dependencies, although there are inspirations from all over. Also, there's no SPM for now.
